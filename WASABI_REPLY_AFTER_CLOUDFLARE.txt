Subject: RE: Public Access Request - CloudFlare Integration Complete

Thank you for the quick response!

I have successfully integrated CloudFlare CDN with Wasabi. Here is the requested information:


CNAME RECORDS:

1. assets.shoutout.us → s3.us-central-1.wasabisys.com (Proxied via CloudFlare)
   For bucket: shoutout-assets

2. videos.shoutout.us → s3.us-central-1.wasabisys.com (Proxied via CloudFlare)
   For bucket: shoutoutorders


CONTACT PHONE NUMBER:

CloudFlare Configuration:
- Cache Level: Cache Everything
- Edge Cache TTL: 1 month (minimizes direct Wasabi egress)
- Browser Cache TTL: 4 hours
- All requests to our Wasabi buckets are routed through CloudFlare's CDN

This configuration ensures compliance with your egress policy by caching the majority of requests at CloudFlare's edge servers.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any other steps required to enable public access for these buckets.

Thank you for your assistance!
