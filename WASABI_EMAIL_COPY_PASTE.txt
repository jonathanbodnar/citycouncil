Subject: Request for Public Access Approval - Video Marketplace Platform

Dear Wasabi Support Team,

I am writing to request approval for public access configuration on my Wasabi storage buckets for my production application.


USE CASE OVERVIEW

I operate ShoutOut (https://shoutout.us), a video marketplace platform that connects users with public figures, celebrities, and influencers for personalized video messages. Our platform allows:

- Talent (verified public figures) to upload promotional videos and profile images
- Users to order custom video messages for personal occasions or business purposes
- Delivered videos to be viewed directly by customers who purchased them

All content is user-generated and needs to be accessible via direct URLs for:
1. Profile pages displaying talent promotional videos and avatars
2. Customer dashboards where users can view and download their purchased videos
3. Order confirmation emails with embedded video links
4. Social media sharing of promotional content


STORAGE DETAILS

Buckets: 
  - shoutout-assets (images, profile pictures, promotional content)
  - shoutoutorders (customer order videos)

Expected Storage Volume: Starting with ~10-50GB, scaling to 500GB+ over the next 12 months

Expected Monthly Egress: ~100-200GB initially

Average File Sizes: 
  - Images: 500KB - 5MB
  - Videos: 5MB - 50MB per video


INFRASTRUCTURE & COMPLIANCE

To ensure compliance with Wasabi's egress policy and terms of service:

1. CDN Implementation: We will implement CloudFlare CDN caching to minimize direct Wasabi egress
2. Caching Strategy: All static assets (images, videos) will be cached at the edge with appropriate TTLs
3. No Direct Hosting: Videos are not streamed directly from Wasabi; they're cached and delivered via CDN
4. Access Control: While buckets are public, all uploads require authenticated API calls
5. Abuse Prevention: We have content moderation policies and user verification for talent accounts

- Accept that public access may be disabled if policy violations occur
