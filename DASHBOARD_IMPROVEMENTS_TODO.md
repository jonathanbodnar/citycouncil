# Dashboard Link Display Improvements - TODO

## Issues to Fix:
1. Affiliate links - display smaller and separated from regular links
2. Donate/support links - display differently (distinct style)
3. Edit modal - ensure all fields match creation modal

## Current Status:
- Bio page features all working
- Dashboard display needs visual refinement
- EditLinkModal needs field parity check

## Next Steps:
1. Find links display section in BioDashboard (activeTab === 'links')
2. Add conditional styling for affiliate/donate types
3. Audit EditLinkModal vs AddLinkModal fields
4. Test locally before committing
